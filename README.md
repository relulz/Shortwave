## Getting in Touch
If you have any questions regarding the use or development of Shortwave,
want to discuss design or simply hang out, please join us on our [#shortwave:gnome.org](https://matrix.to/#/#shortwave:matrix.org) channel.

## FAQ
- **Why its called 'Shortwave'?**

    Shortwave signals have a very long range because of their very good reflection properties. 
Due to their long range, they can be received almost anywhere in the world. 
The same applies to Internet radio stations, which can also be received almost anywhere in the world.
That's why we decided to call the project 'Shortwave', because internet radio stations and shortwave radio stations share many characteristics.

    If you want to know more about the naming process, you should read this [blog post](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2019/04/26/naming-your-app/)

- **Why I cannot edit stations anymore?**

    The edit feature is disabled because of vandalism. I cannot change this. [More information here](http://www.radio-browser.info/gui/#/) and [here](https://github.com/segler-alex/radiobrowser-api/issues/39)

- **Is Shortwave compatible with the Librem 5 / PinePhone?**

    Yes! We use the awesome [libadwaita](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libadwaita) library to make the interface adaptive. The easiest way to get it on your phone is using the Flatpak package. [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/de.haeckerfelix.Shortwave) provides aarch64 packages.

- **Which database does Shortwave use?**

    [radio-browser.info](http://www.radio-browser.info/gui/#/). It's a community database. Everybody can add information.
    
- **How I can get debug information?**
    Run Shortwave using `RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUST_LOG=shortwave=debug flatpak run de.haeckerfelix.Shortwave` (`.Devel`).
